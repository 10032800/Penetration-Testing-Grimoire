This cheat sheet contains common / default file locations of files to attempt to enumerate while performing a penetration test. For instance, this can be done using a vulnerable web application with an local file inclusion vulnerability, LFI, exploited.
## Common / Default File Paths
* C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
* C:\boot.ini
