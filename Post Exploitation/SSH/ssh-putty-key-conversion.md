# Putty-Tools
If you happen to stumble across a Putty .ppk private key file during your penetration testing, you can use [Putty-Tools](http://www.puttygen.com/)' `puttygen` tool to convert a putty, `.ppk` keyfile into an SSH/RSA keyfile to be used against the target host.
```
root@attacker-machine:~# puttygen my_private_key.ppk -O private-openssh -o keyfile
root@attacker-machine:~# chmood 600 keyfile
root@attacker-machine:~# ssh -l (USERNAME) (TARGET IP ADDRESS) -i keyfile
```
