# MySQL Commands
MySQL can be open on the target server with connections only allowed from localhost. For instance, say we have command injection on a web application and we cat the file `index.php` which includes connections strings to the target's MySQL server as so,
```
...(SNIPPED)...
mysql_connect("localhost", "john", "hiroshima") or die(mysql_error());
...(SNIPPED)...
```
We now know that we can make SQL queries directly from the compromised machine, like so,
```
www-data@target-system:~# mysql -u john -phiroshima -e 'show databases'
mysql
test
webapp
www-data@target-system:~# mysql -u john -phiroshima -D webapp -e 'show tables'
users
www-data@target-system:~# mysql -u john -phiroshima -D webapp -e 'select * from users'
1	admin	5afac8d85f
2	john	66lajGGbla
```
**NOTE:** The `-phiroshima` is not a typo as `-p` requires that you do not include a space before the actual password. The actual password is `hiroshima`
