# LINUX Services
This cheat sheet serves as a placeholder for all service discovery that should be done on a system after compromising it. This is for privilege escalation or simple information gathering for pivoting. 
## Processes and Services
We can list service using the following commands,
```
root@victim-machine:~# ps aux 
```
We can also list the listening services using `netstat` liek so,
```
root@victim-machine:~# netstat -an | grep LISTEN
```
We can get the process ID (PID) of a service by using the port number like so,
```
root@victim-machine:~# fuser -n tcp (PORT NUMBER)
```
Put these togther to get the service running on a port like so,
```
root@victim-machine:~# ps aux | grep $(fuser -n tcp 45295 | awk '{print $2}')
```
