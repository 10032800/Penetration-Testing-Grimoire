# Pivoting to another Target System
During a penetration test, you may find a system which is interconnected to a private network. If this private network is within the scope of the penetration test, we can attempt to "pivot" to these systems and gain further access.
## Netcat as a Port Scanner
Most syetms I compromise don't have `nmap` installed for me to scan the live hosts on the private netwwork. They do, however, often have Netcat installed. Here is how I use Netcat to portscan a system, from a compromised target system,
```
user@target-system:~$ nc -z -v 192.168.122.4 1-1024 2>/dev/stdout| grep -v refused
```
This will port scan all ports from 1-1024.
