# Pivoting to another Target System
During a penetration test, you may find a system which is interconnected to a private network. If this private network is within the scope of the penetration test, we can attempt to "pivot" to these systems and gain further access.
## Netcat as a Port Scanner
Most syetms I compromise don't have `nmap` installed for me to scan the live hosts on the private netwwork. They do, however, often have Netcat installed. Here is how I use Netcat to portscan a system, from a compromised target system,
```
user@target-system:~$ nc -z -v 192.168.122.4 1-1024 2>/dev/stdout| grep -v refused
```
This will port scan all ports from 1-1024.
## Sub Network Configuration
We can add this line to proxychains in /etc/proxychains.conf,
```
127.0.0.1 1080
```
Then start an SSH tunnel to the target system,
```
ssh -L 1080:(PRIV HOST IP ON PROV NETWORK):(PRIV HOST PORT) (TARGET COMPROMISED USER)@(TARGET IP ADDRESS)
```
For example,
```
ssh -L 1080:123.456.789.012:80 foobar@321.543.655.765
```
Will give us access to 123.456.789.012, within the provate network the compromised target system is connected to, on port 80 from our localhost machine. We can then browse to the private host- at localhost port 1080 as if we were on the target system,
```
firefox-esr http://127.0.0.1:1080
```
