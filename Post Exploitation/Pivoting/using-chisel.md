# Chisel
[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) is a great tool for pivoting and creating tunnels to internale networks and systems from a compromised target. It can be uploaded using [various data infiltration techniques](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Post%20Exploitation/data-exfiltration-infiltration.md)
### Chisel Usage by Example
Youtube user IppSec has a [great tutorial](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Post%20Exploitation/data-exfiltration-infiltration.md) on how to use chisel as a tunnel to pvito to internal systems from a compromised system. We will descirbe the entire process with 3 hosts, Attacker, which is our Kali system, the Target which is the compromised host, and the Internal Target, which lies on an internal netework that only the compromised Target system has access to communicate with.

Below are the steps outlined in the tunnel process,
1. Compromise a system as any level shell
   1. This does not have to be a root user
   2. This requires a space to read/write on the host to perform data infiltration.
2. Upload chisel to the target host.
    1. Use simple data infiltration techniques that I have [outlined here.](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Post%20Exploitation/data-exfiltration-infiltration.md)
    2. Ensure the binary tranferred successfully by using `md5sum` or some other hashing mechanism.
3. Start the chisel server on the Attacker machine.
4. Start the chisel client on the compromised Target system and connect back to the Attacker system's server.
