# The Penetration Testing Grimoire
Custom Tools, Cheat Sheets, and Notes from my penetration testing experience. During my studies in labs, I decided to start making notes of these since I won't be using (all of) them on a daily basis.


### gri·moire
#### /ɡrimˈwär/
*noun*

a book of magic spells and invocations.

## [Custom-Built Tools](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Tools/Tools.md)
These are custom scripts or tools that I whipped up during penetration testing labs, capture the flag (CTF), [VulnHUB](https://www.vulnhub.com/), and [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) exercises. 
* [*Tools/Robots.txt.test.sh*](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/OSCP-tools/blob/master/Tools/robots.txt.test.sh) - This tool will grab the robots.txt file and run through each entry to display the HTTP status of the file.
  * Run with `chmod +x robots.txt.test.sh && ./robots.txt.test.sh`
* [*Tools/ntlm-bf.sh*](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/OSCP-tools/blob/master/Tools/ntlm-bf.sh) - This tool will loop through a text file and try every password with the username of "admin"
  * Run with `chmod +x bf.sh && ./bf.sh (URI) (PATH TO WORD LIST) (UID)`
* [*Tools/nmap-parse-ports.sh*](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Tools/nmap-parse-ports.sh) - Thi tool parses the normal `nmap -v (TARAGET IP ADDRESS)` output into a CSV for `nmap -A -p (CSV) (TARGET IP ADDRESS)` See Tools.md in that folder for full reference.

### Vulnerabilities:
These cheat sheets are focused on identifiying and exploiting common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and post exploitation practices to gain further access or information in target systems during a penetration test. 
#### Web Vulnerabilities
This subsection includes commmon web vulnerabilities to look for during a penetration test.
* [*Vulnerabilities/Web/initial_scan.md*](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/OSCP-tools/blob/master/Vulnerabilities/Web/initial_scan.md) - This cheat sheet contains all steps taken when a web application service is discovered on the target host.

Some of the hydra syntax is often tricky and "most users [ will get ] it mixed up."
* [*Vulnerabilities/Web/SQLMap.md*](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/OSCP-tools/blob/master/Vulnerabilities/Web/SQLMap.md) - This isn't really a "cheat sheet" but more like a reference made from experience on the subject. SQLMap is a great tool for web application penetration testing, but, without development experience, it may be a bit confusing.

#### SSH Vulnerabilities
* [*Vulnerabilities/SSH/key-exploit.md*](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/OSCP-tools/blob/master/Vulnerabilities/SSH/key-exploit.md) - This module describes how to exploit weak SSH keys generated by vulnerabile systems with predictable PRNGs.
