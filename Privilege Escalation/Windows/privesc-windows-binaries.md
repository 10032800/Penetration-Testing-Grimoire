# Standalone Windows Binaries for Privilege Escalation 
This is a list of binaries and scripts (in the form of Python, Bat, Perl, etc) that can be infiltrated to target systems to test for weaknesses that may lead to successful privilege escalation on Microsoft Windows systems. 
## Watson
[Watson](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson) - is a (.NET 2.0 compliant) C# implementation of a binary which helps to quickly find missing software patches for local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
## Windows-Privesc-Check
[Windows PrivEsc Check](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/windows-privesc-check) - Windows-privesc-check is standalone executable that runs on Windows systems. It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases).
## BeRoot
[BeRoot](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot) - BeRoot Project is a post exploitation tool, written in Python, to check common misconfigurations to find a way to escalate our privilege.
## RottenPotatoNG
[RottenPotatoNG](https://github.com/breenmachine/RottenPotatoNG) - Is a privilege escalation tool which uses tokens. It performs an attack and gets a handle to a privileged token. Then binary then pops an elevated CMD.exe shell.
