## Windows-Privesc-Check
[Windows PrivEsc Check](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/windows-privesc-check) - Windows-privesc-check is standalone executable that runs on Windows systems.

## BeRoot
[BeRoot](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot) - BeRoot Project is a post exploitation tool, written in Python, to check common misconfigurations to find a way to escalate our privilege.
