# Flow Charts
A perfect flow-chart for use during penetration testing is like a magical unicorn. It just can't exist. The main reason is that there are far too many variables that we will undoubtedly encounter. 

The best that we can do is ensure that we have taken all of the necessary steps for enumeration and vulnerability testing as possible. These "flow charts" are simply an outline of all steps that we should at least try during the penetration tests.
